1) Write a program to accepts two numbers from stdin and find all the odd as well as even
numbers present in between them.

import java.util.*;
public class acad {
public static void main(String args[])
{
	int a,b,c;
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
	a=sc.nextInt();                                   //taking first number as input
 	b=sc.nextInt();                                    //taking second number as input
	for(int i=a;i<=b;i++)
  {
    if(i%2==0)
    {
      System.out.println("Even numbers "+i);
    }
    else
    System.out.println("Odd numbers "+i);
 }
 }
}

2) Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked the reason, joe said she is unable to
complete the task given by her teacher. The task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the
number entered from stdin.

import java.util.*;
public class acad {
public static void main(String args[])
{
	int a,b,c;
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
  System.out.println("Input");
	a=sc.nextInt();                                   //taking number as input
  for(int i=1;i<=10;i++)
  {
     b=a*i;
    System.out.println(a+"X"+i+"="+b);            //prints the multiple
}
}
}

3) Write a program consisting method sum() and demonstrate the concept of method
overloading using this method.

import java.util.*;
public class acad {
public static void main(String args[])
{
	int a,b,c;
	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
 	a=sc.nextInt();                                   //taking first number as input   
	b=sc.nextInt();                                    //taking second number as input
	c=sc.nextInt();                                    //taking third number as input
  sum(a);
  sum(a,b);
  sum(a,b,c);
	
}
public static void sum(int a)
{
   System.out.println("Sum method with one parameter" +a);
}

public static void sum(int a,int b)
{
   System.out.println("Sum method with two parameters" +a+" and "+b);
}

public static void sum(int a,int b,int c)
{
   System.out.println("Sum method with three parameters" +a+" and "+b" and "+c);
}
}
